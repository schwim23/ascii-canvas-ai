I need to build a scalable e-commerce platform for selling products online.

The system should support:
- User authentication and profile management
- Product catalog with search and filtering
- Shopping cart functionality
- Payment processing with multiple payment methods
- Order management and tracking
- Email notifications for orders
- Admin dashboard for managing products and orders

The platform needs to handle high traffic during sales events and should be
designed for scalability and reliability. We expect to integrate with
third-party services for payments (Stripe/PayPal) and shipping providers.
